                    <h1>Why Anonymity for Questions? Why Transparency for Answers?</h1>
                    <p class="large-text">We believe the most honest questions are often the hardest to ask. Fear of judgment can prevent us from seeking knowledge on sensitive or complex topics. AnonAsk was created to solve this problem by protecting the person asking the question, creating a safe space for true curiosity.</p>
                    <p class="large-text">At the same time, we believe answers should be backed by credibility. By having our community answer publicly, we foster a culture of accountability and trust. This unique balance allows for vulnerable questions to be met with responsible, transparent answers.</p>
