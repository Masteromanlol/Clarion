                    <p class="large-text">Clarion was founded on a simple but powerful idea: that the truth is not found in a single answer, but in the patterns of many. In today's digital world, asking a question online can lead to a chaotic flood of information, biased algorithms, and heated arguments. It’s hard to know who to trust or what the general consensus really is.</p>
                    <p class="large-text">I created Clarion to solve this problem. I believe that everyone has valuable knowledge to share, and that by bringing those voices together in a structured way, we can achieve a more honest and complete understanding of any topic.</p>
